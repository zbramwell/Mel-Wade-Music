        <h2 class="title">About</h2>
    
        <p class="aboutP">Mel Wade’s genre of bluesy-folk soul grew from the musical seeds planted throughout her childhood. One of nine children, Mel began playing the piano at the ripe age of six, singing with her family as a matter of course. After receiving a guitar from a brother while still a teenager, Mel pulled from her exposure to artists like Tracy Chapman, Joni Mitchell, Edie Brickell, Natalie Merchant, and Sarah McLachlan to inspire and then find her own musical voice. Her first song, “Highway Ride,” speaks to those family roots and broader musical influences.</p>

        <p class="aboutP">While honing her skills as a singer/songwriter, Mel crafted a collection of tunes that jump-started her career and landed on her debut album, “Solitude.” Exploring the challenges of love, loss, and longing in a musical blend of emotional acoustics and simple orchestration, “Solitude” composes the faultless soundtrack for the considerate seeker of constructed identity and its purpose.</p>
        <p class="aboutP">With her voice as the lead instrument and guitar picking as support, Mel’s next album will explore the layers between honesty and judgment. Each new song stretches her voice and fingers, forcing a lyrical dance between the two. With a bit of rooted soul and even more bluesy folk, Mel’s newly defined approach is creating a novel narrative for her evolving sound.</p>
